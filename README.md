# My-XFWM-Theme-Collection

*PLEASE NOTE THESE ARE JUST THE XFWM THEMES, THEY DO NOT COME WITH THE GTK THEMES*

XFWM themes and gtk.css files for my XFCE setup. These XFWM themes were inspired by addy-dclxvi's XFWM theme pack [(Addy's github page)](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi). Aswell as the GTK themes pack from Archcraft [(PLease check out this awesome OS !!)](https://github.com/archcraft-os)

[**Please download these GTK themes to go with the XFWM themes**](https://github.com/archcraft-os/archcraft-gtk-themes)
